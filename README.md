## **Some Considerations before we begin**
- We are assuming that teachers are given sufficient resources/internet and also infra facilities to stream lectures
- Our Understanding is that we are providing remote education to students until government has enough data on student demographics/attendance etc to provide proper infrastructure to the students.

## **WHAT ARE THE PROBLEMS??**
![Problemstatement](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9b42f51-fe85-460f-b3e3-b579f2dc44d1)


## **OUR FOCUS CONSIDERING THESE PROBLEMS**

1. **Provide AI-Generated Resources:** Provide a one-stop solution for teachers and students with AI-generated resources, saving time and cost compared to physical resources.
2. **Implement Low-Internet Services:** Develop solutions that function well with limited internet connectivity.
3. **Enhance Engagement(MAJOR PROBLEM IN ONLINE EDUCATION):** Even if we provide all resources , many students dont really utilize these things, so we have various modules to encourage students to learn.
4. **Identify At-Risk Students:** Help identify students who are weaker, have lower attendance, or are at risk of dropping out and improve engagement by 1 on 1 counselling by teachers.
5. **Analytics for Decision Making:** Provide detailed analytics on student demographics to aid in decision-making and resource allocation by government

## **With these things in mind We have divided our project into 2 parts**
- **1)Live ( low latency ) streaming of video lectures Module with use of websockets/webrtc.**
- Here students will just join classroom and teacher would teach like in a regular meet but through low data consumption and better human interaction.
- **2)PreRecorded Lecture VideoPlayback/Engagement Enhancer Module using Azure CDN( low data consumption)**
- Here there is loads of ai generated resources, engagement enhancing resources which generate interests in learning and all given through lowest data consumption on a prerecorded lecture.

## OUR RESEARCH ON LOW LATENCY VIDEO STREAMING

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b05952ec-310a-410e-bcbf-3fc51c4d6121)


**Optimized for Low Data Usage and Enhanced Remote Education**
# Comparison of Our Platform with Google Meet/Unacademy/Physicswallah/Microsoft Teams
---
## **How We Reduced Data Usage**

Our platform uniquely addresses data consumption issues, which is a major concern in remote education:


**1) Pre-Downloaded PowerPoint Slides:** (Consumption of data 40-50 mb per hour)
- To optimize data usage, our solution pre-downloads the PowerPoint slides and broadcasts only the slide number that changes.
- This approach significantly reduces the data required for streaming.
- The slide number update is communicated through **WebSocket**, ensuring that the React app synchronizes to the corresponding slide efficiently and **its streamed to all participants**
- Typical data usage is just 30-40 mb as slides switched are not too often and 10mb for ppt download
  
**2) Audio Streaming through WebRTC:** (Consumption of data 30-60 mb per hour)
- We use WebRTC for audio streaming, which ensures low latency and high-quality audio while minimizing data consumption.
  
**3) Jamboard Integration: (5-10 mb per hour)** 
- A streamlined version of Jamboard is included on the right side of the screen to assist teachers in explaining the content of the PowerPoint. This addition ensures that while the slides provide the primary content, the Jamboard supports interactive explanations.

- By focusing on these optimizations, we ensure that data usage remains minimal, with most streaming happening at low latency and with low data consumption.

## **Data Usage Comparison and Latency Comparison with existing platforms**

### **Google Meet**

| **Type**           | **Latency** | **Low Quality (360p)** | **Standard Quality (480p)** | **High Quality (720p)** | **HD Quality (1080p)** |
|--------------------|-------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Video + Audio**  | ~500 ms      |  1 GB per hour         | ~1 GB to 1.5 GB per hour     | ~1.5 GB to 2.5 GB per hour| ~2.5 GB to 4 GB per hour|

### **Our Platform ( Why we only considered websockets(for ppt state variable updation ) and webrtc ( for audio streaming)**

| **Technology**           | **Type**        | **Latency** | **Resolution** | **Data Usage (per hour)** |
|--------------------------|-----------------|-------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| **WebRTC Audio Only**    | Audio Only       | 100-300 ms   | N/A            | 30-60 MB                  |
| **WebSocket Audio Only** | Audio Only(Less reliable for audio) | 100-300 ms   | N/A            | 30-60 MB                  |
| **WebRTC Video + Audio** | Video & Audio    | 100-500 ms   | 720p/1080p     | 1.5-6 GB                  |
| **WebSocket Video + Audio** | Video & Audio | 100-500 ms   | 720p/1080p     | 1.5-6 GB                  |

## This is the reason we only considred audio of webrtc + updation of slides through websockets so that we could have ultimate version of low latency online education.

| **Primary Use**           | Media processing, encoding, decoding    | Real-time peer-to-peer communication      | Real-time client-server communication  |
| **Communication Type**    | Typically client-server                 | Peer-to-peer                              | Client-server                          |
| **Protocols Used**        | RTMP, RTP, HTTP, RTSP                    | UDP (primarily), TCP                      | TCP                                    |
| **Latency**               | Moderate to high                        | Low latency                               | Low latency                             |
| **Reliability**           | High for media processing               | Less reliable with UDP (packet loss), more with TCP | High reliability with TCP     |

## OUR PLAN IS DIVIDED INTO 2 PARTS AS I HAVE MENTIONED BEFORE


## **Plan Part 1 : Smartboard + Pre-Downloaded PPT + Audio (100MB)**

- **Overview:** Integrates WebSockets/WebRTC for audio streaming and pre-downloaded PowerPoint slides.
- **Components:**
  - **Audio Streaming:** WebSockets/WebRTC for low-latency audio.
  - **PPT Slides:** Pre-downloaded slides with updates broadcasted via WebSocket.
- **Implementation:** Students access audio and slides with minimal data usage. Changes in slides are efficiently communicated to the React app.
- **Bandwidth Usage:**
  - **Audio Only:** ~30 MB - 60 MB per hour.
  - **PPT:** Minimal impact (pre-downloaded).

## **Advantages**


1. **Optimized Data Usage:** Our platform reduces data consumption by pre-downloading PowerPoint slides and synchronizing slide changes via WebSocket. This minimizes the bandwidth impact of screen sharing.
2. **Efficient Content Delivery:** Leveraging WebRTC for audio streaming and a streamlined Jamboard integration ensures a low-bandwidth, high-quality educational experience.
3. **Low Bandwidth Requirements:** Designed for low-bandwidth environments, our platform provides a smooth educational experience even in remote areas.
4. **High-Quality Playback:** Azure CDN ensures smooth video playback and reduces buffering.


---
## **Plan part 2 : Enagement Enhancer Module(MOST DATA CONSUMPTION WILL ONLY BE IN RETRIEVAL OF RESOURCES FROM DATABASES which will be OVERALL MINIMAL)**
- SO After live stream teacher will upload the lecture where azure cdn and engagement enhancer module will come to play.

---
## **AI-Resource Generation: HOW WE ENSURE EFFICIENT AND LOW DATA CONSUMPTION**

- **AI Resources Are Generated Once and Stored:**
  - AI-generated resources (e.g., notes, quizzes, flowcharts) are created once during video upload.
  - Resources are stored in **Azure Blob Storage** and **MongoDB Atlas**, ensuring quick access without reprocessing.
  - This approach saves compute power and reduces data transfer costs.

- **Use of Lightweight APIs for Resource Generation:**
  - APIs such as **Groq API for LLaMA**, **Gemini API**, **Mistral 7B**, and **LangChain** are used for generating adaptive quizzes, notes, and diagrams.
  - These apis help to minimize memory and processing power consumption.

- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for Efficient AI Processing:**
  - RAG methods are applied to video transcriptions and captions to ensure high-accuracy resource generation.
  - This approach avoids unnecessary computation and reduces redundancy, streamlining the process.

- **Minimized Data Transfer for Engagement Enhancer Module:**
  - The **Engagement Enhancer Module** (quizzes, chatbots, visual aids) is designed for low data consumption.
  - Only small data packets, such as quiz responses or real-time visualizations retrieval from database, are transmitted, significantly reducing data usage compared to live-streamed alternatives.
 
- **AI-Generated Content Delivery via Azure CDN: WHY AZURE CDN YOU MAY ASK SEE BELOW**
  - All AI-generated content (videos, notes, visualizations) is delivered via **Azure CDN**.
  - This ensures low-latency content delivery and minimal bandwidth usage, even in low-internet environments.


## **Advantages**

## **Advantages of Azure CDN for Remote Education for downloading of video/playback of video and also for scalability**

 - This module takes your tests in any language you are comfortable with.
 - Also analysis of your answers are shown just below, we are still working on making it more student friendly!.

   

### **Previous Methodology(OUR TRIAL AND ERROR/Research )**

- Previously, NLP-based methods were used for question generation, but they were resource-intensive and less accurate. 
- We transitioned to advanced LLMs like LLAMA and Gemini for better performance.
- We have gone from T5, to BERT to Mistral7B to Groq LLAMA and Gemini.
- So entire process of research has been done to get the best mcqs
